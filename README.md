## Important Note: Chatbot API Integration

Please note that the Chatbot's smooth response is powered by the OpenAI API, which offers advanced natural language processing capabilities. However, it's important to be aware that the OpenAI API is not available for free and involves costs based on usage.

When you obtain access to the OpenAI API and integrate it into the application, you'll experience the enhanced conversational quality and contextual understanding that comes with the API's capabilities.

To ensure the optimal performance and seamless responses of the Chatbot, consider acquiring access to the OpenAI API. This will enable you to fully utilize the power of advanced AI-powered conversations within the application.
